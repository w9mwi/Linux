LINUX COMMANDS
==============


FIND COMMAND EXAMPLES
=====================
$ find -iname JSPWiki*
$ find . -name TestFile.txt	(Find a file called TestFile.txt in current and all sub-directories, case sensitive.)
$ find . -iname \*.xml  (Finds all files ending in ".xml" in all sub-directories, case insensitive.)
$ find . -name .svn | xargs rm -r  (Remove all directories named .svn located in the current directory,
                                    AND all subdirectories.)
$ find /home -user exampleuser -mtime 7 -iname ".db"  (Find all .db files in the /home directory, modified in the
                                                       last 7 days by a user named exampleuser, case insensitive.)
  FIND OPTIONS:
  -iname  (Search without regard for text case.)
  -not    (Return only results that do not match the test case.)
  -type f  (Search for files.)
  -type d  (Search for directories.)


GREP COMMAND EXAMPLES
=====================

Recursively search all files in the current directory AND child directories for the string '13.jpg' (case insensitive).
   -r = recursive
   -i = case insensitive
$  grep -ir '13.jpg' .
$  grep -ir '13.jpg' ./*xml
$  grep -r "mystery string" /home/junk  (-r searches all child directories recursively.)
$  grep -i "mystery string" /home/junk  (-i ignores case.)


CHMOD COMMAND EXAMPLES
======================
The chmod command changes the access permissions of files and folders.

$ ll readme.txt
  -rw-rw-r-- 1 jsmith jsmith 0 Nov 13 14:07 readme.txt
$ chmod 777 readme.txt

The first 7 sets the USER permissions.
The second 7 sets the GROUP permissions.
The third 7 sets the permissions for everybody else.

7 = rwx = read, write, and execute
6 = rw- = read and write
5 = r-x = read and execute
4 = r-- = read-only
3 = -wx = write and execute
2 = -w- = write only
1 = --x = execute only
0 = --- = none

$ ll
  -rwxrwxrwx 1 jsmith jsmith 0 Nov 13 14:07 readme.txt*

The '1' in the following 'chmod 1777' command sets the 'sticky bit' of the
readme.txt file.  This means only the file owner, the directory owner, or
the root superuser can delete the file, regardless of the file's group
permissions.  Notice the last 3 'rwx' permission chars change to 'rwt'

$ chmod 1777 readme.txt
$ ll
  -rwxrwxrwt 1 jsmith jsmith 0 Nov 13 14:07 readme.txt*


CHOWN COMMAND EXAMPLES
======================
The chown command changes the user and/or group ownership
for given file or directory.  When you list a file, and the
following displays, 'jsmith' is the owner and 'programmer'
is the group.

$ ll readme.txt
  -rw-rw-r-- 1 jsmith programmer 0 Nov 13 14:07 readme.txt

$ chown owner-user filename
$ chown owner-user:owner-group filename
$ chown owner-user:owner-group directoryname
$ chown options owner-user:owner-group filename


TOUCH COMMAND EXAMPLES
======================
touch -t 8001031305 oldfile  #Changes the modification time/date of oldfile to 13:05 on January 3, 1980.
