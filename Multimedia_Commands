AUDIO - CDPARANOIA LINUX APPLICATION COMMAND EXAMPLES
=====================================================
SEE --> http://www.linux-commands-examples.com/cdparanoia

Extract only the 3rd track of the CD to a file...
$ cdparanoia 3 /home/tbouril/DaveMason_3.flac

Extract tracks 1 through 3 of the CD to a file...
$ cdparanoia 1-3 /home/tbouril/DaveMason_1to3.flac

Extract the only the first track of the CD to a file...
$ cdparanoia -- -1 /home/tbouril/DaveMason_1.flac

Extract the first 2 tracks (songs) of the CD to a single file...
$ cdparanoia -- -2 /home/tbouril/DaveMason_2.flac

Visually display the data contents of the CD.  Use that information
to rip individual tracks from the CD to a file by running a command
similar to the one shown below in the next example.
$ cdparanoia -vsQ

Extract the following from the CD to a single file
FROM: Track 1 at 3:02.12
TO:   Track 2 at 4:30
$ cdparanoia "1[3:02.12]-2[4:30]" /home/tbouril/DaveMason_4.flac


VIDEO - CONVERT .VOB VIDEO FILES TO .MP4 OR .MPG VIDEO FILES
============================================================
To convert a single .VOB file named VTS_01_1.VOB to a single .mp4
or .mpg file, run one of these commands from the command line:

ffmpeg -i  MyVobFile.VOB   MyMp4File.mp4
ffmpeg -i  MyVobFile.VOB   MyMpgFile.mpg

The following command converts a .mp4 file to a .mpg, where the
.mpg file will be NTSC compatible (for American TVs), and have
an aspect ratio of 16:9.

ffmpeg -i  MyMp4File.mp4  -target ntsc-dvd -aspect 16:9  MyMpgFile.mpg


To convert multiple .vob files into a single .mp4 file,
first create a .txt file containing all your .vob file
names, in the order you want the video files to play.
In this example, we'll name that .txt file "input_files.txt",
which contains this text:

file 'MyVobFile_1.vob'
file 'MyVobFile_2.vob'

Then, run this command from the command line, which will create
a new file named MyMp4File.mp4.
$ ffmpeg -f concat -i input_files.txt -codec copy MyMp4File.mp4


DVD VIDEO DISC EXPLANATION OF FILE NAMES
========================================
A video DVD that plays on a DVD player contains two parent directories having these names:

AUDIO_TS - This directory is almost always empty.  It will only contain files on a
           DVD audio disc, not a DVD video disc. These were a niche, high-fidelity
           audio format that never achieved widespread popularity. 
VIDEO_TS - The files contained in this directory can be different from DVD to DVD.
           However, the filenames in the VIDEO_TS directory will follow the
           conventions explained here...

VIDEO_TS.IFO - REQUIRED.  The Video Manager Information file.  It contains control and
               playback information for the entire DVD, including menus, regional coding,
               and title locations.  Without it, a DVD player cannot navigate the disc.
VIDEO_TS.VOB - NOT REQUIRED.  A Video Object file that holds the first-play content,
               which is typically a copyright notice, a studio logo, or the main menu.
VIDEO_TS.BUP - NOT REQUIRED.  An identical backup copy of the VIDEO_TS.IFO file.


VTS_01_0.IFO - REQUIRED IF A VIDEO TITLE IS PRESENT.  The information file for the
               first Video Title Set.  It stores data about the titles and chapters.
VTS_01_0.BUP - NOT REQUIRED.  An identical backup copy of the VTS_01_0.IFO file.
VTS_01_0.VOB - NOT REQUIRED.  Contains the menu for the first video title.
VTS_01_1.VOB - REQUIRED.  Contains the actual video data for the first title.
               Commercial movies often split this content into multiple VOB files
               (VTS_01_1.VOB, VTS_01_2.VOB, VTS_01_3.VOB, etc.) to adhere to file
               size limits.

If the DVD contains multiple titles/videos (i.e., multiple episodes of a TV show),
the second episode will contain filenames having the prefix 'VTS_02', the third
episode will have the filename prefix 'VTS_03', etc.  These files will be
identical in behavior as filenames having the 'VTS_01' prefix described above.


HOW TO MAKE A NEW DVD VIDEO DISC FROM .VOB FILES COPIED FROM OTHER DVDS
=======================================================================
Assume you want to copy certain .VOB video files from one or more DVD video
discs to a new DVD disc, so the new DVD will play on a DVD player.  If you
directly copy those .VOB video files to the new DVD, it won't play on a
DVD player.  To make this work, follow these instructions.

NOTE: Following these instructions will create a DVD that will play all
      video files on the DVD, from the first video to the last video.
      There will be no menu to select which video you want to play.

1) Copy the .VOB video files, ONE AT A TIME, from the DVD(s) to a temp directory
   on your computer.  After each .VOB file is copied, rename the .VOB file in
   your temp directory so its filename has a number for a prefix as shown below.
   The number will correspond to the order you want the video files to play on the
   DVD player.  For example, the 01.VOB video file will be the FIRST video to
   play on the DVD player, the 02.VOB file will be the SECOND file to play, the
   05.VOB video file will be the FIFTH video to play.

   01.VOB
   02.VOB
   03.VOB

   WARNING:  Make certain all these .VOB video files combined won't exceed the
             4.7 GB capacity of a DVD.  To be safe, all the .VOB video files
             combined should not exceed approx. 4.4 GB.  Because the new DVD
             you create will include additional files, and not just video files.

2) Convert all the .VOB files in your temp directory to .mpg files by running
   the "ffmpeg" command as shown below.  These newly-created .mpg files will
   have the NTSC format (720 pixels wide, 480 pixels high) for American TVs,
   and have an aspect ratio of 16:9.

   ffmpeg -i  01.VOB  -target ntsc-dvd -aspect 16:9  01.mpg
   ffmpeg -i  02.VOB  -target ntsc-dvd -aspect 16:9  02.mpg
   ffmpeg -i  03.VOB  -target ntsc-dvd -aspect 16:9  03.mpg

3) Using a text editor, create a new file named 'dvd.xml' inside the
   same directory that contains the 01.mpg, 02.mpg, and 03.mpg files.
   Place the following text inside the dvd.xml file.

   <dvdauthor>
     <vmgm />
     <titleset>
       <titles>
         <pgc>
           <vob file="01.mpg" />
           <vob file="02.mpg" />
           <vob file="03.mpg" />
           <post>jump chapter 1;</post>
         </pgc>
       </titles>
     </titleset>
   </dvdauthor>

4) From your temp directory, run the following linux command:
   dvd-menu -i menu.png -o menu.vob -s 2 -x dvd.xml

4) From the same directory that contains the dvdauthor.xml and the .mpg files,
   run the following two linux commands from the command line:

   export VIDEO_FORMAT=NTSC
   dvdauthor -o . -x dvdauthor.xml

   This will generate the AUDIO_TS and VIDEO_TS directories.  The AUDIO_TS
   directory will be empty, and the VIDEO_TS directory will contain all
   the related video files.

5) Check the total size of the combined AUDIO_TS and VIDEO_TS directories to make
   certain they're less than 4.7 GB, which is the maximum capacity of a DVD.

   Now copy both the AUDIO_TS and VIDEO_TS directories to your new DVD disc.  You
   can now play that DVD on a DVD player.  The DVD won't contain a menu to select
   your videos.  It will just play all the video files on the DVD in the order
   they appear in the above dvdauthor.xml file.
